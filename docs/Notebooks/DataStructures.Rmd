## Vector

This is a simple one dimensional data structure used for storing *ordered* collections of items of the same data type. For instance, we can store the numbers 10 through 20 and then call the first item in that collection (10) by doing the following: 

```{r}
x <- 10:20
x[1]
```

We can also store the letters A through J and retrieve either the fourth item *or* the letter D.

```{r}
y <- letters[1:10]
y[4]
which(y=="d")
```


Notice that *R* is 1-indexed, not 0-indexed like many other languages (Python, C#, etc.)

## Matrix

A two dimensional collection of data. All elements in a matrix ***Must*** be of a consistant type (i.e. all numeric or all character). Because matricies are two dimentional, they have two indicies that can be specified to recal a value. If we create a 3x3 matrix that looks like this: 

|     | col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|
|Row 1| 1     | 2     | 3     |
|Row 2| 4     | 5     | 6     |
|Row 3| 7     | 8     | 9     |

we can recall the value `8` by getting the value in the third row and second column. This can be accomplished as so: 

```{r}
matrixData <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = T)
matrixData[3,2]
```

As you can see, the `[]` operator is used to subset a data object. In the case of a vector, we only require one number (corresponding to the index). However, in the case of a matrix, we require two numbers. The first number is the row number and the second number is the column number. 

We can also subset matricies by name.

```{r}
colnames(matrixData) <- c("col 1", "col 2", "col 3")
row.names(matrixData) <- c("row 1", "row 2", "row 3")
matrixData['row 3','col 2']
```

## Data Frame

A data frame is a very popular data structure since it is like a matrix but can hold different types of data. This is a lot like what you expect to find in an Excel file. Below is a dataset that is built into R and is also an example of a data frame: 

```{r}
iris
```

Notice that this dataset not only includes numerical variables but also a character (specifically factor) variable. This flexibility is what makes data frames popular. 

## List

The last common data structure is a list. Like the data frame, lists can hold multiple data types and can even hold a Data Frame within it. For example, let's create three different data sources: a vector, matrix, and data frame: 

```{r}
v <- 1:10
m <- matrix(1:9,3,3,T)
df <- iris
```

Now, let's add all three of these items to a list:

```{r}
l <- list(v,m,df)
```

We can check the structure of our list with the `str()` command:

```{r}
str(l)
```

With this output, you can tell that `l` is a list with three items. The first item is an int vector, the second is an int matrix and the third is a data frame with 150 observations.

If we wanted to recall one of these items in the list, we still use the `[]` operator but we need **double** brackets this time. For example, the following will simply print out the first and third items in the list.

```{r}
l[[1]]
l[[3]]
```

but the following will print the item in the first row and fourth column of the data frame (third item in the list)

```{r}
l[[3]][1,4]
```
