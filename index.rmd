## A Brief introduction to R


So you're interested in R huh? Great! The documents in this repository will help you get started in data analytics using one of the most powerful open source tools for the job. Below is a suggested reading hierarchy but feel free to skip around as you see fit.  Many of these documents will either be referenced or influenced by other sources around the internet. If this is the case, I will be sure to either link directly to the source or provide references where appropriate.

Before you get started, you will need to download [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for your operating system. The Windows 10 versions are [here](https://cran.mtu.edu/bin/windows/base/R-3.5.1-win.exe) and [here](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.1.456.exe).

After you've done that, you might find it helpful to progress through [this free lesson](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/chapters/orientation/continue) on data camp that will get you oriented with the RStudio IDE. Whether or not you view the lesson, all content for this introduction to R is located under the topics tab above. You can choose to read through the information in order or skip around as you see fit. 

This is by no means an extensive course on R. Those have been done by many others more knowledgeable than I. You can find some of them in the Recommended Courses tab above. Instead, this will be a brief overview of what working within the R environment looks like and some of the perks that it offers. If at any point you have questions regarding this content feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelabarrows) or post a comment on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/MBarrows20/RIntroduction) associated with this repository. You should also feel free to clone, download, or share this repository as it is open source.
