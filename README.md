# RIntroduction

## Introduction
This repository populates this [RIntroduction](https://mbarrows20.github.io/RIntroduction/) website. 
While there are many resources available to help you learn the same topics, the information I present here is meant to be a bare-bones
introduction that will suppliment an in-person presentation. Over time, this repository might evolve to be more extensive and free-standing.

In the meantime, if you crave more information on the topic of R, I list three great referrences in the "Courses" section of the website.
I have personally completed 2/3 of them and would highly recommend them. 

I would love for others to contribute to this repository in any way they see fit. Even if it is a small spelling fix, please help me make this
resource the best that it can be! 

## Basic Folder Function

All site Pages are left in the home folder and have both a __.Rmd__ and __.html__ version. The html version is automatically 
built by knitting the Rmd file.
